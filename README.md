Elgg File Viewer
================

An extension to the file plugin that integrates third-party services
and providers to render files inline:

* Microsoft Office files (Office Web Viewer integration)
* PDFs and other common file types (Google Docs Viewer integration)
* Video (Projekktor + DivX integration)
* Audio (audio.js integration)
* Text/Code (SyntaxHighlighter integration)


## Notes ##

* Access to non-public files by Office Web Viewer and
Google Docs Viewer is managed via Elgg's web services API. You must therefore
enable Enable Web Services API via Administration > Configure > Settings >
